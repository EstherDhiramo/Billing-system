# Billing-system
Shop Billing System is based on the concept of generating the total bill of a shopâ€™s transaction. It contains an admin login system. The admin can easily manage and view all the transactions. This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one.

Talking about the features of the Shop Billing system, the user can generate a total bill of an item by entering the number of items, name, quantity, and price per item. After all this, the system generates a total amount with VAT and asks for the amount paid and displays the total return amount to the user. The last feature includes a list of all transactions with transaction id.
